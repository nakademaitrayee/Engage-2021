# Microsoft-Engage-2021
This Application was made as a part of Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2021. The web Application named 'Class Activity' is made to increase the collaboration of student and faculty in classroom both - in person classes and in hybrid environment. This application helps the users to create, post and take surveys, which can be attempted by other users, and a Real Time Results Summary is updated as the users choose their options. This is a small attempt to increase the Engagement between students and Faculty :)
